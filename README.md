--StratagemOS--
A HellDivers 2 reference. A NixOS config, with DWM, HomeManager, and some cool scripts.

Not much is here currently, and I am working on it actively.

Most of the stuff is going to be in Rust and Nix because I'm fimilar with those two.

As you can probably tell from the other stuff, I am new to this kind of thing, but am fimilar with Linux in general. I hope this can sprout into something!

Things to do:
  Add Rust scripts for stratagem codes (cool)
  Figure out how to do some basic GUI things needed
  See if I can make the display manager take stratagem codes as passwords because cool
  Color everything helldivers and ricing dwm with some gaps and rounding and top bar plugins.
  Get sleep
