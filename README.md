# StratagemOS
A HellDivers 2 reference. A NixOS config, with DWM, HomeManager, and some cool scripts.

Not much is here currently, and I am working on it actively.
I am going to make most of the programs in bash & Rust because thats what I know.
I also picked NixOS because I know it and it's easy to make a configuration.nix that can be used to make a custom system anywhere compared to making your own Arch linux ISO.
